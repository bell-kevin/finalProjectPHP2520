# Final Project Instructions

Thoroughly read all of the instructions on this page before beginning your project.

See an instructor to ensure that you completely understand the Final Project for this course, and to discuss the details of the project you plan to create. Make sure to have instructor approval, then complete the project.

## Overview
The final project for this course project will consist of the design, development, testing, and debugging of a database driven web application using PHP & MySQL. Develop a simple CMS or a web application of your choice. Choose an application of personal creative or professional interest. Note: Your project must demonstrate competency with the material covered in this course and must be discussed and approved in advance by an instructor.

Examples of applications that can be built for this assignment include: 

- A pizza ordering system or other site for a company where it displays its products. 

- A gaming or sports tournament site, where users can see game results, aggregate scores and comment on them.

- A very simple community where users can have personal profile pages, a status line and send each other messages.

- A site for a club, a church/mosque/synagogue/temple or an association, with information about activities.

If you can't think of anything else, use the Pacific Trails site. Convert the existing reservations page to a Contact Us page and then build a new reservations page that allows customers to book one of several yurts and rooms in the lodge. Your back-end should show available rooms and which ones are already booked. You should have the customer info on file and attached to the booked room.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
